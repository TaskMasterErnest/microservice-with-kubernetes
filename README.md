# microservice-with-kubernetes
A repo containing code regarding my experience with planning, developing and operating large-scale cloud-native systems using using microservice-based architecture on Kubernetes.

I will be doing most of the testing with KinD on my local machine. And then for production, I will switch to using Kubernetes on AWS with EKS or when the documentation ofmy walkthrough demands it.
